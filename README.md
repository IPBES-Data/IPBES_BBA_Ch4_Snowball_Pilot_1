## Folders

- **`data`**: data files created during the running of the `snowball.qmd` file and contains cached as well as final data files.
- **`figures`**: figures created during the running of the `snowball.qmd` file in low-res as well as high-res.
- **`Key Papers`**: Key papers for the snowball pilot and a `.csv` and `.bib` file with the references
- **`R`**: R scripts used to create the figures and tables in the `snowball.qmd` file. Files in this folder will be sourced initially. These will later be moved into an R package.
