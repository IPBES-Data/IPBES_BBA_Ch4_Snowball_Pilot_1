## Folders

- **`data`**: data files created during the running of the `snowball.qmd` file and contains cached as well as final data files.
- **`figures`**: figures created during the running of the `snowball.qmd` file in low-res as well as high-res.
- **`Key Papers`**: Key papers for the snowball pilot and a `.csv` and `.bib` file with the references
- **`R`**: R scripts used to create the figures and tables in the `snowball.qmd` file. Files in this folder will be sourced initially. These will later be moved into an R package.

## Status

- [x] Kepypaper were imported into Zotero and the `csv` and `bib` files were exported
- [x] `snowball.qmd` report file was created and the `R` scripts added
- [x] `snowball.html` report created and data files and figures created
- [ ] literature search will be done for two clusters
  - [ ] **authors** will provide key papers fand suggestions for possible additional search strateies to get the literature
  - [ ] citation clusters will be build for each and shown separately and combined
- [ ] Integrate reports into citation network
  - [ ] **Aidin** will investigate identification of link networks on the internet starting from identified reports
  - [ ] **Rainer** will investigate the possibility to use the `R` package `scholar` to identify papers citing the reports
  - [ ] **Rainer** will assess if the references can be extracted from the reports provided
