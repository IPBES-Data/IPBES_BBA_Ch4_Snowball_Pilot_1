## Folders

- **`data`**: data files created during the running of the `snowball.qmd` file and contains cached as well as final data files.
- **`figures`**: figures created during the running of the `snowball.qmd` file in low-res as well as high-res.
- **`Key Papers`**: Key papers for the snowball pilot and a `.csv` and `.bib` file with the references
- **`R`**: R scripts used to create the figures and tables in the `snowball.qmd` file. Files in this folder will be sourced initially. These will later be moved into an R package.

## Status
### Done
- [x] Kepypaper were imported into Zotero and the `csv` and `bib` files were exported
- [x] `snowball.qmd` report file was created and the `R` scripts added
- [x] `snowball.html` report created and data files and figures created

### TODO

- [ ] What to do with the reports?
  - [ ] extracting references manually?
  - [ ] extracting all links to websites?

It is not possible to identify papers citing the report, unless the report is in the database, i.e. for the moment OpenAlex, which they are not.
