Biodiversity accounting and reporting are relevant for developing organisational practices oriented towards environmental sustainability, promoting cleaner management policies with less impact on the envi­ ronment. Biodiversity accounting research has attracted scholars in business management and accounting, and as a result, the literature in the field has grown in recent years. This study analyses the intellectual structure of the biodiversity accounting and management discipline through a systematic literature review, along with biblio­ metric techniques based on a co-word analysis of the main keywords included in 63 publications. The results reveal five thematic clusters: one motor cluster (sustainability), two transversal clusters (biodiversity reporting, corporate biodiversity management) and two isolated clusters (environmental protection, emancipatory ac­ counting). In addition, the content of the selected papers is analysed and promising research paths are found, such as the need for more robust quantitative analyses or the development of new forms of emancipatory ac­ counting. The study discusses the main insights from the analysis, proposes future research directions and provides practical implications for biodiversity protection and environmental sustainability.","2022-10","2023-09-24 11:33:46","2023-09-24 11:33:46","2023-09-24 11:33:46","133677","","","371","","Journal of Cleaner Production","Biodiversity accounting and reporting","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero Business and Biodiversity/storage/77S96FMA/Blanco-Zaitegi et al_2022_Biodiversity accounting and reporting.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is the first time four major areas of leading research in this field have been identified and reviewed simultaneously on the basis of their differences in scope (company, ecosystem or national) and purposes (logics of management accounting or balance sheet). In this paper, the usefulness of pursuing the growth in the developing field of “ecosystem-centric management accounting” is highlighted and makes assessment and monitoring of environmental results possible. In the field of social and environmental accounting, the suggested classification offers one form of response to the main test which arises from discussions over the interlinking of private and collective accounting systems.","2021-01-07","2023-09-24 11:33:47","2023-09-24 11:33:48","2023-09-24 11:33:47","13-50","","1","Tome 27","","","Innovations comptables pour la biodiversité et les écosystèmes","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/rainerkrug/Zotero Business and Biodiversity/storage/ZM2SURXX/Feger_Mermet_2021_Innovations comptables pour la biodiversité et les écosystèmes.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
